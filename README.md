# strand-auth
A standalone Authentication &amp; Identity microservice that can be integrated into any monolith or microservice ecosystem

## Vision & Scope
The `strand-auth` provides a standalone, extensible authentication and identity layer 
that can be plugged into any application â€” monolith or microservice.  
- Supports multiple authentication mechanisms (username, email, mobile, 2FA).  
- Designed with token flexibility (JWT or PASETO, hybrid stateful refresh).  
- Enterprise-ready features like RBAC, audit logs, and immediate revocation.  

The goal: make authentication **modular, secure, and easy to integrate** without locking into a specific tech stack.
