# nest-auth-boilerplate
A standalone Authentication &amp; Identity microservice that can be integrated into any monolith or microservice ecosystem

## Vision & Scope
- The goal of this boilerplate is to provide a production-ready authentication boilerplate for NestJS applications.
- Instead of starting from scratch or wiring common auth patterns repeatedly, developers get a secure, extensible, and opinionated foundation that covers industry best practices out of the box.
- This project aims to:
-- Reduce setup friction for new NestJS projects.
-- Enforce security best practices (opaque tokens, session management, soft deletes, MFA, DTO validation, etc.).
-- Stay modular so developers can extend or replace parts (e.g., swap DB from Postgres to MariaDB, or plug in Redis for session store).
-- Serve as a reference architecture for enterprise-grade auth systems.
-- Ultimately, it should allow teams to focus on business logic, not auth plumbing.

## Tech Stack
**MVP**
- Framework: NestJS
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: TypeORM
- Cache/Revocation: Redis/Valkey
- Authentication Tokens: JWT & PASETO (configurable)
- Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose (deployment-ready)
- Testing: Jest + Supertest

**MVP Features**
- User registeration & login (username, email, mobile with verification)
- 2FA (TOTP) optional
- Token management (JWT or PASETO) with hybrid refresh flow
- Basic RBAC (roles & permissions)

**Future / Roadmap**
- Messaging Queues: RabbitMQ/Kafka - for OTP, email and audit logging

### üîí Security & Authentication
- Passwordless authentication - magic links or OTP-based login
- WebAuthn support

### üë• Authorization & Governance
- ABAC in addition to RBAC
- Policy engine integration
- Tenant-aware RBAC

### üìä Observability & Compliance
- Compliance modules - GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA log retention helpers. 
- Rate limiting & anomaly detection ‚Äì stop brute-force and token abuse.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Developer & Ops Experience
- Admin dashboard / Management UI ‚Äì manage users, sessions, policies.
- Configurable deployment modes ‚Äì monolith-friendly vs microservice-first.
